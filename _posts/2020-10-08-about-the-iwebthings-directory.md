The [_i.webthings directory_](https://directory.jenett.org/ "an eclectic selection of sites to explore, curated by a fellow human"), just launched this month, is an extension of the work done over the years at [_the dailywebthing linkport_](https://the.dailywebthing.com/ "providing links to resources, diversions, initiatives, and software (for starters) since 2004, updated daily") and the [_dailywebthing daily pointers_](https://pointers.dailywebthing.com/ "providing links to personal blogs and other independent, noncommercial sites since 2000, updated daily"). My mission has always been to provide web surfers with ways to explore the independent and noncommercial web.

It&#8217;s not complicated. I enjoy helping others discover new, interesting, and sometimes useful things on the web, free of commercialism and annoyance and understand only a small subset of web surfers share my tastes and sensitivities. It&#8217;s subjective but if just one other person out there finds one of my discovery vehicles to be enjoyable or useful, I&#8217;m a happy camper.

As far as the directory goes, I&#8217;m only including blogs and websites which are noncommercial and free of ads, commerce, and annoyances. In my mind, _commerce-free_ blogs or sites do not offer goods for sale or services for hire, nor do they use monetized links (i.e., affiliate links) in their content. My idea of _annoyance_ is simple too. If a site uses promotional overlays, slide-ins, popups, or ads, I won&#8217;t link to it. 

That&#8217;s not to say there&#8217;s anything wrong with blogs or sites which don&#8217;t meet the criteria I use. I respect everyone&#8217;s right to do their thing their way, which is exactly what I&#8217;m trying to do here.

Thanks,
