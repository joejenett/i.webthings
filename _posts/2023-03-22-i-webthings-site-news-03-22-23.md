<p>I’m still restoring some configurations lost due to the recent server failure. My hosting provider and I have been working hard over the last 4-5 days to get all my sites back online. Now that my sites are back, I’m working to restore everything else as it was before the fiasco.</p>
<p>When it all started, I decided to serve this site from GitHub instead of its original URL. That way, I was able to stay in touch with y’all after the rest of my web went down. I’ve decided to keep this site at this URL at least until I restore the lost configurations.</p>
<p>All redirects pertaining to the iwebthings hub were among those affected. That means for now, if you’re linking to previous site versions' permalinks or following a redirected RSS feed, the needed redirects may be among those missing at the moment.</p>
<p>As time allows, I hope to restore everything - in the meantime, thanks for your patience and for being here.</p>
