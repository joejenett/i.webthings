This morning as I&#8217;m catching up on that linking thing I do, the words of a certain [cool curator](https://www.kickscondor.com/luming-hao "Kicks Condor") grab my attention. It&#8217;s a stream of consciousness kind of thing (I really enjoy) that urges me to visit the [linked site](http://luminghao.com/ "is luming hao's website"). As I enter the site, its style/flavor immediately reminds me of another site I consider to be [a classic](http://www.yhchang.com/ "Y0UNG-HAE CHANG HEAVY INDUSTRIES").

My mind&#8217;s in fun mode now and I start exploring Kicks&#8217; linked site. The first thing I encounter is [a piece](https://soundcloud.com/stardotdotdot/string-quartet-01) a for piano and violin created by the site&#8217;s author, Luming Hao. It&#8217;s different &#8211; eerie and engaging. Nice. Then I explore the [song](https://unclebusiness.bandcamp.com/track/thats-what-you-get-for-wearing-sandals-on-christmas-you-asshole "That's What You Get For Wearing Sandals on Christmas You Asshole") that inspired the piece, a freeform head-banger that&#8217;s most listenable. I&#8217;m smiling now, thinking how thankful I am when the surf leads to magical things.

Inspiring!
