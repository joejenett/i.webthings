summary: It’s all in the tools baby!

When I find a time saver or tool that improves my workflow, I like sharing it. Much of what I know comes from others’ generous sharing of ideas and solutions. It’s kinda like _paying it forward_ - feels right.

Okay, so sometimes such sharing can backfire on you (or should I say _me_) like the recent Firefox extension I enthusiastically shared that ended up causing a big problem - disappearing recent browsing history (a key tool in my workflow). It turned my _recommend_ to _do not recommend_ just like that. But I digress.

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for creating and editing posts here and at [simply.](https://simply.jenett.org/) and recently bumped into a [plugin](https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title) to “automatically fetch the titles of pasted links” (via [oldtowneast](https://pinboard.in/u:oldtowneast)). It‘s called _Auto Link Title_ and you can find it Settings > Community plugins in the Obsidian app. You’ll encounter a message about disabling ‘Safe Mode’ in order to use community plugins. Please note the warning message, thank you.

Anyway, I like the way it works - it simplified writing this post a bit.

Cheers!
