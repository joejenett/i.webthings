     What feed do we follow now if we want to subscribe to everything in one go?

         Hey Poorchop,
         
         Unfortunately, the i.webthings feed will no longer include items from my other sites. This change was of one of many in progress related to simplifying my web a bit. I‚Äôll be writing more about this soon.
         
         For now, I‚Äôll look into a new solution for ‚Äòeverything in one go‚Äô ‚Äì in the meantime, thanks for putting up with multiple feeds‚Ä¶

         Here‚Äôs something that works for now (for my 4 key sites) ‚Äì [http://www.rssmix.com/u/13170286/rss.xml](http://www.rssmix.com/u/13170286/rss.xml)

         I created another feed which has the same 4 key sites plus jenett.wiki and joe.ideas (6 sites total) ‚Äì [http://www.rssmix.com/u/13172921/rss.xml](http://www.rssmix.com/u/13172921/rss.xml)
         
         I‚Äôll include this information in the upcoming write-up about the changes to my web.
         
         Hope you find it useful. üòé
         
         update 07/17/21: Neither of these combined feeds are reliable (and I don‚Äôt recommend them). Today‚Äôs early morning posts still aren‚Äôt showing up as of 7:00 p.m. Oh well.

             Thanks. Kind of sad to see the hub feed go but I can understand wanting to simplify things.
