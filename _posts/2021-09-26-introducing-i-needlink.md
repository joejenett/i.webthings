I share a lot of links, at least 4 per day every day. I love doing it but sometimes it’s hard to find new things to link to. I need a link dammit!

If you could just share with me a site you love to visit. Just one. In the act of my asking you to share a little something special with me, this platform could become something you’ll find really useful when you need a link. Share a link, find a link. Like that. So please gimme a link, thank you!

<form action="https://jenett.org/i.needalink/needalink.cgi" method="post">
url of link you want to share:<br>
<input style="margin-bottom:9px;width:70%;" name="url" placeholder="please include ‘http://’ or ‘https://’"><br>
your name (optional):<br>
<input style="margin-bottom:9px;" name="name" placeholder="name"><br>
your homepage (optional):<br>
<input style="margin-bottom:9px;width:70%;" name="homepage" placeholder="please include ‘http://’ or ‘https://’"><br>
<input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>

<p><br />Oh yeah - and thanks for visiting.</p>
