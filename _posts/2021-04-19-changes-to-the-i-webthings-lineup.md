Effective today, [linkscatter](https://linkscatter.com/) and [jenett. photo.](https://photo.jenett.org/) have been retired and will no longer be updated. Both sites have been converted to static pages and will remain online as browsable archives.<!-- excerpt-end -->  Though some functionality has been eliminated in moving these sites away from WordPress, permalinks to content have not changed.

Thanks,

joe jenett
