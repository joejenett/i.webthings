It&#8217;s obvious you can find anything you&#8217;re looking for on the web. There are plenty of sites linking to commercial and professional sites and blogs featuring book reviews with affiliate links. It&#8217;s easy to find links to ad-infested news, novelty, and technology-related destinations on the web, and sites using intrusive overlays and slide-outs. All these sites can be useful when that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for.

## but there&#8217;s an alternative

What if you just want to explore people and ideas without being distracted by attempts to sell you something or annoying you with intrusive advertising and promotion?

That&#8217;s why I created _dailywebthing daily pointers_ back in 2000. I like to think I&#8217;m providing a means to explore the web of atypical people and ideas without all the noise. That&#8217;s why I link.
